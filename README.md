#Description
This is the second learning project by UnityCodeMonkey. 
It is available at https://unitycodemonkey.com/courses.php?c=turnbasedstrategy

I intend to thoroughly go through it making notes, researching every topic that was covered and coding along. 
I as well intend to explicitly do everything, except for the art and sound, myself as the idea behind it is to improve my skills.

#Overrides
1. I changed the way Units rotate using Vector3.Lerp properly.
In the course it is used with transform.position that is changed on Update so the progression is not linear and it is neverending.
My take makes the Lerp linear.
